**BIOINFORMATICS DATABASES FOR CANCER**

Some of the major trends in modern medical research, regarding medical genomics, include extensive sequencing databases and web tools (Brito _et al._, 2021). Among the different types of bioinformatics databases used in cancer research, five that will be discussed are The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), cBioPortal, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

The COSMIC is useful for exploring the effect of somatic mutations in human cancer (Sanger Institute, 2024). The database can be applied to identifying mutations that are drivers of cancer, characterizing the mutational landscape of certain types of cancer and tumors, studying therapeutic targets, and biomarker discovery and validation associated with cancer prognosis, treatment response, and patient outcome (Sanger Institute, 2024).  

The Cancer Genome Atlas database possesses datasets that are used by scientists studying metagenomics, immunology, and other diseases (Yaspan _et al_., 2017). The TCGA datasets have deepened our understanding of cancer through molecular characterization (NCI, 2019). The TCGA database profiles multi-omics data on cancer patients on a large scale to facilitate diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. It contains genomic, transcriptomic, DNA methylation, and proteomic data of thousands of patient tissue samples representative of 26 types of cancer (Li _et al_., 2020)

cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is an open-source, open-access resource for interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics datasets. The portal supports and stores non-synonymous mutations, mRNA and microRNA expression data, portal level, and phosphoprotein level data among others (Cerami _et al._, 2012). It also supports visualization of mutations in the context of protein domains and complements the existing tools including the TCGA portals (Cerami _et al._, 2012).

The CCLE represents a database that provides a comprehensive genetic and pharmacologic description of a wide range of human cancer models. It seeks to link specific pharmacologic vulnerabilities to genomic patterns, using this information to classify cancer patients (DeepMap, 2021). 

The GEO is a public data repository that archives and freely distributes microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomics data (NCBI, 2024). It provides mechanisms that allow users to query, locate, review, and download studies and gene expression profiles for diseases of interest including cancer (NCBI, 2024). 

Various Bioinformatics databases have changed the dimensions of cancer research. These resources provide extensive data and bioinformatic tools for researchers to understand several aspects of cancer, which, in turn, provide more sensitive diagnoses and targeted therapies.
